        <h4>Hi and welcome to my page!</h4>
        <p> My interest for coding started when I had to learn to manage my home bakery website.
            With time, my interest grew and it led to a QA internship.
            By end of my internship, I was determined to invest more time into my new passion.
            This led me to The Iron Yard. At TIY I transitioned from being a hobbyist to a coder.
            When I am not coding, I bake, volunteer at my kidsâ€™ school,
            mentor girls on their education and careers and travel with my family.
        </p>
        <p>My skills sets are in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React</p>

                ToyExchange is an app for parents to exchange toys. This was
                my final project at The Iron Yard coding school. This is a complete app built in 2 weeks.
                The app uses a Rails back-end and a React front-end for the search filter.
                This project was a stretch and I learned a lot: Device gem, Facebook API, Refile and Amazon S3.

                      Spacebook is an app where companies with multiple campuses can book rooms for events.
                      This project was a full stack group project for the Rails class.
                      The team did the design, front-end using React and back-end using Rails.
                      I contributed to the design and used React to build search filtering.
                      This project was a great experience working with a team and practicing Agile methedology.

                      Movie Voter app was a group project where I was
                      the back-end developer. My group consisted of a front-end developer and a designer.
                      This app showcases a complete Rails API with all the CRUD actions necessary for the site to function.
                      This project was a great opportunity to work on a team with all three skill sets contributing.
